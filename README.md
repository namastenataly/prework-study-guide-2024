# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation is to become a full stack web developer and find a remote job in the field. I built this project because I wanted to learn basic knowledge about HTML, CSS, Javascript and deploying my code for the world to see. It solved my issues with connecting the terminal to VS Code to Github which I was struggling with. I learned how to connect different branches to the main branch and upload all my code to Github to share/collaborate with other peers/coworkers in the future. I also learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript terminology and techniques to make my code function. Lastly, I learned how to debug code issues by using the console.
